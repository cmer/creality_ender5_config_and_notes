# Ender 5 Config for Marlin 2.0.x

These are my config files for Marlin. The include multiple tweaks I found all over the Interwebs, including, but likely not limited to:

- [Teaching Tech: Ender 3 BLtouch vanilla Marlin guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUlqrSq6LeY&t=324s)
- [Teaching Tech: BLtouch advanced guide: Fully automated bed homing and levelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV11-VOQjMc)
- [Marlin 2.0 program memory usage by feature on AVR 8Bit boards](https://www.crosslink.io/marlin-2-0-memory-usage-by-feature/)

### My current setup:

- Creality Ender 5
- Creality 1.1.4 stock controller board (8-bit)
- [Genuine BL Touch w/ mounting kit](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/creality-bl-touch)
- Creality glass bed

### Notes:

- Z Probe Offset should be calculated and configured. See: [Calibrating Z-Offset With A BLTouch Bed Levelling Probe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_1Kg45APko) -- See GCODEs in the description. I didn't use Pronterface. Instead, I used OctoPrint to type them in the console.
- Esteps and flow rate should be calibrated. See: [Esteps and Flow Rate using Octoprint and Free Air Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVljfDVPp3o) or [3D Printer Extruder Calibration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzQjtWhg9VE)
