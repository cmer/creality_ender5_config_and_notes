# Ender 5 Config for Marlin 2.0.x

These are my config files for Marlin. The include multiple tweaks I found all over the Interwebs, including, but likely not limited to:

- [Teaching Tech: Ender 3 BLtouch vanilla Marlin guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUlqrSq6LeY&t=324s)
- [Teaching Tech: BLtouch advanced guide: Fully automated bed homing and levelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV11-VOQjMc)
- [Marlin 2.0 program memory usage by feature on AVR 8Bit boards](https://www.crosslink.io/marlin-2-0-memory-usage-by-feature/)

My current setup:

- Creality Ender 5
- Creality 1.1.4 stock controller board (8-bit)
- [Genuine BL Touch w/ mounting kit](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/creality-bl-touch)
